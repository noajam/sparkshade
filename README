# Graphics (CSCI 5229) Final Project
## Simple Horror Scene
## By Noah James, Graduate Student

### Instructions
run `make` in directory using given makefile.
Execute the compiled executable: "development.exe".

### References
* Uses sample code from Example 37 for shadow mapping.
* Framebuffer code for depth texture by Jay Kominek.

### Specifications and Details
* GLSL version 1.5 compatibility mode.
* Renders scene with shadow mapping and spark particle effects.

### To-do List
- Make particle sparks follow lightbulb
- Make particle sparks travel faster without lengthening lines (might just use GL_POINTS)
- Edit the color of particle sparks in fragment shader to be more realistic
- Turn off light when particle effects are active (as if the lightbulb short circuited)
- Render desktop computer object
- Render keyboard on desk
- Render door
- Fix first-person mode and add collision with objects and walls
- Add scene progression and interactivity (turning lightbulb on and off for example)
- Edit lighting to be darker overall
